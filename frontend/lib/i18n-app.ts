/**
 * Copy for the signed-in surfaces: sign-in, the app bar, the worklist, senior
 * detail, the family summary, the check-in simulator and the ops dashboard.
 *
 * Kept apart from lib/i18n.ts, which holds the landing page, so neither file
 * becomes unreadable. Same contract: `AppCopy` is written out explicitly, so
 * a missing Hindi string is a compile error rather than an English sentence
 * appearing in the middle of a Hindi page.
 *
 * THE RULES THE HINDI KEEPS, same as everywhere else:
 *  1. Nothing names a condition. "निदान कभी नहीं करता" is translated as the
 *     promise it is, never softened.
 *  2. A senior's own words are never translated. The check-in script and the
 *     quoted cues stay exactly as spoken — see lib/demo-i18n.ts.
 *  3. Statements about what a role CANNOT see stay absolute. "There is no
 *     policy granting them" must not become "they are not shown".
